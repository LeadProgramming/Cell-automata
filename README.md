# Cellular Automa Ant #12

Welcome to Cella Ant #12. This algorithm uses a LLRR traversal. 
- From the low bit, the triangle turns right when the current state is either a 0 or 1. 
- From the high bit the triangle turns left when the current state is either a 2 or 3. 
- If the current state is greater than 3, then the current state will be reseted to 0. 
- The four state are associated in the following order: green(0), red(1), yellow(2), blue(3). 

This project showcases artificial life. Watch it come to life by navigating to the "335-p1-DN" folder and click on the html file. Then, on your browser you will see the small cell which you can control with the given controls.  

## Setup:
1. Main HTML file is cella_ant_12.html, a web page.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "assets".
3. Web page links to (loads) assets/styles.css.
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.

## Executing:
5. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.

## Acknowledgement:

The professor source code was the foundation of the codebase. I modified the source code so that it can run Cella Ant 12 sucessfully. Thanks to the professor I did not have to recreate the wheel. 

In order to code this program sucessfully I had to read basic JavaScript from a tutorial website called javascript.info.
