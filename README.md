Introduction: 

Welcome to Cella Ant #12. The algorithm I used is a LLRR traversal. From the low bit, the triangle turns right when the current state is either on 0 or 1. From the high bit the triangle turns left when the current state is either on 2 or 3. If the current state is greater than 3, then the current state will be reseted to 0. The four state are associated in the following order: black(0), red(1), yellow(2), blue(3). This cellular automaton project showcases artificial life. Watch it come to life by opening the html file. 

Contents:

335-p1-DN folder:
cella_ant_12.html
README.txt

assets folder:
styles.css
tools.js

External Requirements:

None

Setup:

1. Main HTML file is cella_ant_12.html, a web page.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "assets".
3. Web page links to (loads) assets/styles.css.
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.

How to run the script onto the web page:
5. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.

(*) Key: use fcn key F12 to open a "javascript console" in your browser to debug issues. 

Features:

The professor source code was the foundation of the codebase. I modified the source code so that it can run Cella Ant 12 sucessfully. Thanks to the professor I did not have to recreate the wheel. 

In order to code this program sucessfully I had to read basic JavaScript from a tutorial website called javascript.info. 
Bugs:

None
